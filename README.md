# Animal-Giphy

https://frozen-scrubland-43987.herokuapp.com/

Make ajax calls on the giphy.com api with dynamic user-entered data.

The user can name any animal in the input box and a button with that name will be rendered. (Also, any topic supported by giphy can be entered here).

If the button is clicked, the first ten (10) results will render as still images.  If you click on any image it will toggle to the animated version of the same image.

This is a purely front-end app with a node server added for the purposes of deploying to heroku.
